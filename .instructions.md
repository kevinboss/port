# Port - Docker Management CLI

This file contains high-level instructions for code generation in the Port project. More specific instructions are available in dedicated files for each component area:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - General project architecture and patterns
- `.instructions/commands.md` - Command implementation patterns
- `.instructions/queries.md` - Query implementation patterns
- `.instructions/domain.md` - Domain model guidelines
- `.instructions/console.md` - Console output formatting

## Key Principles

1. **Interface-First Design**: Define interfaces before implementations
2. **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection for all dependencies
3. **CQRS Pattern**: Separate queries (data retrieval) from commands (actions)
4. **Clean Architecture**: Maintain separation of concerns
5. **Consistent Naming**: Follow established naming conventions

## Project Structure

- **Commands/**: Organized by functionality (Commit, Config, List, etc.)
- **Config/**: Configuration classes with versioning
- **Infrastructure/**: DI infrastructure components
- **Spectre/**: Custom console implementations

## When Adding New Code

Always follow the established patterns for the type of component you're adding:
- For commands, see `.instructions/commands.md`
- For queries, see `.instructions/queries.md`
- For domain models, see `.instructions/domain.md`
- For console output, see `.instructions/console.md`
